# Java Data Structures

This folder contains the projects that I completed when learning about Data Structures and Basic Search Algorithmns.

1. **Linked Lists**
    * Demonstrating how the ArrayList Object works in Java Ordered or Un-Ordered
2. **Most Recently Used List (MRU List)**
    * Demonstrating a ordering type for lists, This project also includes testing using JUnit.
3. **Binary Search Tree**
    * Demonstrating a BST by reading file and retrieving all the unique words.
4. **Hashing**
    * Demonstrating my attempt in creating the most efficient hashing function I possibly can.
    It shows a readme of my trial and error logs or my efforts of trying to reduce the amount
    of collisions when inserting data.
