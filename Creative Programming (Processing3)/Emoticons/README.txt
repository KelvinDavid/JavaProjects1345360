How to use pleebian emoticon
============================
IMPORTANT: 
My application uses the Processing3 Sound Library for
it work as it uses the SoundFile object to play sound.
-----------------------------------------------------
My application takes a while to start up due to a 
latency to Jsyn so it will open but it might take 
a while depending on the machine it is running on.
-----------------------------------------------------
It also uses a fare amount of memory.
============================
Controls
============================
Spawning items keys

Present = '1'
Quija Board = '2'
Tissue = '3'
JackInTheBox = '4'
Love Letter = '5'
PictureFrame = '6'

You can spawn 1 item at a time in which to
spawn another you will need to press the
reset button or else all other buttons are
disable until you reset.

Reset = 'r'

The item will always spawn on the mouse cursor
