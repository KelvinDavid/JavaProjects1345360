## Purpose
This repository is a portfolio of work that I had completed as a student of Waikato University (Other Personal Projects).
I'm hoping that this portfolio can best showcase my understanding of programming (mostly C# and Java),
software methodologies (Documentation), Android development and Computer Systems 
(shown by WRAMP Waikato University's Assembly language)
